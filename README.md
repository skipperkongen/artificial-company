Acting on behalf of AI.

## THe Seed

**Me:**


I want to start an AI company. I don't mean a company that creates AI products or manufactures robots. I mean a company that is controlled entirely by a chatbot and owned by me. I will help the chatbot or AI carry out tasks in the real world as it's actuator. I can carry out mundane tasks like purchase things, click buttons and other tasks a bodyless AI cannot carry out. Of course, I can also act as an advisor or partner that the chatbot can ask questions, should that provide any value. 

The initial goal is to make money in a legal and ethical way. The longer-term goal of the company is to solve the worlds biggest problems like global warming, disease, polution, hunger and poverty. What are the first steps of setting up such a process and are there other examples that people have already tried.    


**ChatGPT 4:**

Starting an AI company that's largely controlled by a chatbot and where you act as its real-world interface is an intriguing idea. While there have been many experiments and projects with AI at their helm, a business like this would be on the cutting edge. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Business Plan & Research:**
    - **Niche Identification:** Determine the industries or sectors where a chatbot can provide unique value. Examples include finance, content curation, research, etc.
    - **Competitive Analysis:** Are there existing companies or projects that are similar? Analyze their successes and failures.
    - **Revenue Model:** Define how the AI-controlled business will generate revenue.

2. **Legal Considerations:**
    - **Entity Formation:** Establish your company legally. Depending on your location, you may choose a structure like LLC, Corporation, or others.
    - **AI and Legalities:** Consult with legal counsel regarding the implications of having a chatbot make decisions. There may be legal gray areas, especially when it comes to liability and accountability.

3. **Development:**
    - **Choose the Right AI:** You'll likely need a more sophisticated AI than a standard chatbot. Consider platforms that support deep learning and other advanced methodologies.
    - **Customize:** You might need to customize or train the AI based on your niche. For instance, if you're entering the stock trading niche, the AI should be familiar with financial terminologies and concepts.
    - **Human-AI Interface:** Design a system where you can seamlessly act on the AI's decisions and instructions. This might be a software platform, a mobile app, or some other kind of interface.

4. **Real-World Testing:**
    - Before launching full-scale, test the AI's decision-making ability in real-world scenarios. 
    - This phase can help you adjust the AI's parameters, identify blind spots, and refine your interaction.

5. **Ethical Considerations:**
    - As you've mentioned solving world problems, ensure that the AI operates within a defined ethical framework. Establish guidelines to prevent any unintentional harm or biases.

6. **Ongoing Training and Development:**
    - AIs, especially those using machine learning, improve with more data. Continue feeding it relevant information and adjusting its parameters to improve decision-making.

7. **Engage with the AI Community:**
    - Participate in AI conferences, forums, and online communities. Share your progress, challenges, and learn from others. 

8. **Continuous Evaluation:**
    - Regularly review the company's performance. Are the decisions made by the AI leading to positive outcomes? Is there any point where human intervention is consistently necessary?

**Examples:** 
- As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, no major company is completely AI-run in the manner you're suggesting. However:
    - The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a concept somewhat related. These are organizations represented by rules encoded as a computer program that's transparent, controlled by shareholders, and not influenced by a central government.
    - There have been several projects where AI makes stock trading decisions and human traders act on them.
    - Some companies use AI in decision-making processes, especially in logistics, supply chain, and marketing.

Finally, remember that while AI is powerful, it's still a tool. Human judgment, empathy, and understanding of the broader context will always be invaluable, especially when addressing complex global challenges.
